n = 5
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n = n-1
    # print('Blastoff')
    # Typing print statement indented with other statements in while loops it also so we get Blastoff printed after every number
print('Blastoff')
# Above print statement is one level left of other statements in while i.e aligned with the while statement which is why it is ran after the while loop executes
